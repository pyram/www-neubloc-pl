Outsourcing software development to India has become a venture that claims to offer better cost savings and faster product development. But, over the past few years, more and more companies are turning back to the US for their software development. This is because India’s lack of resource availability, quality and communication has highlighted why sending projects to the country often leads in higher costs and poorer quality of products.
</p>
 

  <h3>Resources are Lacking</h3>
Resources in India are highly complex. Finding the talent needed to develop your software product is hard enough, and there are more jobs open in India than there are qualified individuals. Even if you are able to find a company to outsource development to, it could take you months to find that person.
<h3>The Quality of Resources is Poor</h3>
In the United States, it takes years to become a great software developer. You spend years in school and refining your skill. But, in India a lot of people who are given software development jobs have had less than six months of training and some have had only a few weeks. These people with no technical background are hired to fill highly technical roles – leaving you with unqualified individuals handling your project.
<h3>Turnover Rates are Tremendously High</h3>
In India, most software development companies have a significant turnover rate. Usually they encounter 8 to 10 percent. While this number doesn’t sound significant, if you ask the same company what their turnover rate is on a project, you’ll see numbers that are in the 50 percent mark. That means 50 percent of the staff that starts on your project will not be there by the end.
<h3>Communications Are Difficult</h3>
The time difference alone between the United States and India is enough. With a 12 hour difference, there is no reasonable hour you can speak to your software development team in India without staying up until the middle of the night. That means you often are left communicating via email, which means slower delivery times and more holds on your project.
<h3>Work Ethics Are Lacking</h3>
It can be difficult to motivate the employees in India to work quickly on your project. In fact, it could be weeks or even months with little to no progress on the project itself. This is primarily due to a communication and cultural differences issue. The employees in India don’t understand the ultimate goal of your development project. They don’t understand how it will be used – they will never use it themselves – therefore, it is hard to be motivated to work hard and deliver quality work.
<h3>You’ll Spend More in the Long Run</h3>
<p>
  
Most people assume that outsourcing to India means significant cost-savings. You pay a blended rate to the firm handling your project, but you don’t know what you’re paying for. In most cases, you’re paying for one senior development professional, and the rest are trainees that have little to no software development experience. That leaves you with low-quality workforce and a low-quality product.

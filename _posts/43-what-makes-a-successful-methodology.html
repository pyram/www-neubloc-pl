								<p>Methodologies are used to structure projects and provide a course that avoids common pitfalls. A well-founded methodology incorporates:</p>
<ul style="list-style-position: inside;">
	<li>Solid Management Practices</li>
	<li>Iterative Lifecycle Management</li>
	<li>Focuses of Quality</li>
	<li>Includes Client Participation</li>
	<li>Frequent Milestones</li>
	<li>Integrated Global Delivery and Delivery Process</li>
</ul>
 
<p>So how can one choose the best methodology? There are several things to consider and they are outlined in the process below:</p>

<p>Methodologies can be classified into three types:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Classic Waterfall</li>
	<li>Modified Waterfall</li>
	<li>Incremental/Agile Development</li>
</ol>

<h1>Classical Waterfall</h1>
<p>This approach works when there is no major rush to bring the product to the market and when the client has a good understanding of what is needed for the next couple versions. To make the system work, use:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Upfront design</li>
	<li>Slightly overlapping Design/Developer/Deploy phases using waterfall release cycles of 6-8 months</li>
</ul>
<h1>Modified Waterfall</h1>
<p>The client knows at least the primary features with only a few requirement changes needed during development, with a moderate rush to bring the product to market.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Design top 50-60% of system upfront</li>
	<li>Use overlapping... 3-6 months</li>
</ul>
<h1>Incremental/Agile Development</h1>
<p>The client requirements change often throughout development and there is a rush to bring the product to market.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Design top 30-40% of the system upfront</li>
	<li>Begin with initial design/development cycle for 2-3 months to ready the baseline framework</li>
	<li>Shift into 2-4 week design/development cycles where system can be deployed at the end of each cycle if necessary</li>
</ul>
<p>Neubloc uses the Building Blocs Method to incorporate the above and establish successful guidelines for software design and development.</p>

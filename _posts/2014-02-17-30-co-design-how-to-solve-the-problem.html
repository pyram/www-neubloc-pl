    <p>Good product design effectively and efficiently meets the user’s function and because of this, defining the user is a crucial step that must be completed before beginning design. To accomplish this, user profiles are created that target market segmentation and address the user’s:</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. Needs</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Expectations</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. Demographics</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">4. Current problems</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">5. Access to available technology and information</p>
    <p>These points make up the contextual knowledge that forms the foundation for co-design. To reach an efficient solution using co-design, it is crucial to keep two things in mind:</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. The users are the experts.</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Proper planning is absolutely essential.</p>
    <h1><strong>Users are Experts</strong></h1>
    <p>Remember that, though the engineers design the product, it is the user who buys it and therefore the product must be tailored to meet the user’s needs. Make it a priority to identify product champions. Involving users for the long term who are creative will provide fantastic product ideas and lead to a better solution.</p>
    <h1>Proper Planning is Essential</h1>
    <p>Proper planning is essential for successful co-design. To reach a deeper understanding of the problem, review all the research and analysis by:</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. Creating user scenarios that represent current user workflows.</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Prepare an agenda with a clear purpose.</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. Highlight the techniques to use.</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">4. Stage a do-design session to push the project forward in an organized manner.</p>

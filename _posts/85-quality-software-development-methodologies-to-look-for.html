If you have been thinking about outsourcing your software development project, you know that it is imperative you start with a quality company. Every company has their own software development methodologies. While there are a standard few that everyone shares, there are others that set apart some companies from the rest – and these are the methodologies to look for in a provider.</p>
 

<h3>Full-Cycle Management</h3>
Successful software development methodologies include focusing on the entire life of the project. That means starting with an accurate estimate of the costs and schedules associated with the development process. By having accurate numbers, you can utilize your resources more efficiently and also track the success of your project. You also want a company that is active at all times during the development process – constantly monitoring, refining and validating your process.
<h3>Quality as a #1 Focus</h3>
There is no point in hiring a software development firm if they don’t have quality as their top priority. You want a company that makes delivering high-quality products their only mission. That includes the design and development process. A company should have a team of quality assurance engineers on staff to monitor the project during the early and developmental stages too. Quality tools that should be used include:
<ul>
	<li>Technical requirement verification</li>
	<li>Usability and user experience testing</li>
	<li>Software testing plans</li>
	<li>Test cases</li>
	<li>Coding reviews</li>
</ul>
<h3>A Global Team</h3>
Sometimes having a global team handling your software development is key. You’ll get your project completed faster – because you have teams working around the clock – and you’ll also have a mixture of experiences to work with. Look for software development methodologies that include global delivery. That means a team of designers, engineers, project leaders, architects and usability specialists from around the world. But, you want to be cautious. The company must have a firm grip on their outsourcing companies – ensuring quality is never lost because of an overseas operation.
<h3>Fast and Efficient Delivery</h3>
A product should be delivered in a timely fashion and ready to use upon delivery. While some companies focus on delivering on a schedule, others use a cyclical phased approach that ensures the end product satisfies your requirements and is user-ready.

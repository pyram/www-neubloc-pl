Cloud storage, a term dating back to the 60’s, refers to the ability of remotely storing data in secure servers, a process which gained popularity among startups due to its innovative and unique infrastructure. It appeals to new startups not just for its ability to store files, photos and other content digitally, but also due to its ability to share information in a universal location.</p>
 

<h3>Why is it important for small businesses?</h3>
<p>The benefits of cloud storage are important for small businesses because it increases productivity at an affordable price. While other large-scale operations can afford to have expensive security and other luxury items, startup companies need to focus their efforts on retaining as much profitability as possible while also spending the least.</p>

<p>Cloud storage provides cheap data security that ensures data remains adequately protected. In addition to having rigorous virus scans and layers of security checks on the data, cloud storage ensures that only authorized users are granted access.
</p>
<p>As a small business, it is already hard enough to stay afloat without having to worry about losing data. The main reason for loss of data is the lack of an adequate backup system. While purchasing a backup system might solve this problem, cloud storage will completely eradicate this worry by creating multiple backups of data that are stored in different locations and regularly synced together. This radically reduces the chance for the loss of data and alleviates concerns and worries.
</p>
<p>Cloud storage allows data to be connected on a global scale. Because of restrictions on a low budget, many small businesses resort to working remotely with other members of the team. This comes with issues of communication and uniformity, which can be fixed rather easily with cloud storage. Cloud storage provides a centralized location for operations, ensuring that all the changes made are up to date and synced.
</p>
<p>In addition, investing in cloud storage also provides an increase in accessibility and file sharing, both of which contribute to the overall productivity of the small business. As stated before, a small business’s main goal is to maximize profits and productivity while minimizing cost. Therefore, the use of cloud storage increases accessibility virtually anywhere and maximizes profits for any small business that invests in this storage system.</p>

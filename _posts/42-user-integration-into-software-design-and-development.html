								<p>Creating user-friendly software products and services add real business value. A usable product:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. Increases user satisfaction</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Increases productivity</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. Leads to brand trust</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">4. Saves costs</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">5. Results in profitability</p>
 
<p>The key to creating user-friendly software is to build a simple user interface (UI). A simple UI guarantees that the user will focus on the positive aspects of the product instead of becoming frustrated with learning how to use it, because most users do not have the time or patience to do this.</p>

<p>A usable user interface shapes the user's perception of a company and no company exemplifies this best than Apple Inc. Apple continues to beat its competitors in delivering software products streamlined for a positive user experience and last year, Apple went a step further when it targeted "next-generation personal computing problems...unique to each region..." like China (Bajarin). In the end, the best promoters of any brand are satisfied customers.</p>

<p>So how can one avoid barriers to effective UI? By first laying the foundation early in the design and development process, through a user-centered design approach. Such a process includes many internal and external benefits:</p>
<h1>Internal ROI</h1>
<ul>
	<li> Increased user productivity</li>
	<li> Decreased user errors</li>
	<li> Decreased training costs</li>
	<li> Greater savings from early adjustments in the design process</li>
</ul>
<h1>External ROI</h1>
<ul>
	<li> Increased sales</li>
	<li> Decreased customer support cost</li>
	<li> Greater savings from early adjustments in the design process</li>
	<li> Decreased training cost</li>
</ul>

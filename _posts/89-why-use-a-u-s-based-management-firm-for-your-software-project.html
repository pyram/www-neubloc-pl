Software design and development is tricky. When you look for a management firm that can help you outsource your design and development, you want one that offers turn-key solutions. While a lot of overseas companies offer effective and affordable management services, they lack the complexity and success record of US-based management firms. There is a distinct difference between a company that is based in the United States and a company that is not. Understanding those differences is important.

  <h3>Accessibility and Accountability are at Their Highest</h3>
If you work with a company overseas, you have to contact them during their operational hours – which may be in the middle of the night in the United States. You won’t be able to fly out and meet with them, unless you don’t mind international travel. Also, the accessibility of the company and their representatives in general is usually limited – due to time zones, language barriers, and work ethic issues. A US company has the same operational hours (with the difference of a few hours for time zones) and doesn’t have any language barriers holding you back from accessing your project.
<h3>There are No Language Barriers</h3>
Language barriers make projects move slower. When you have to have work translated and then re-translated for your software design and development company to work on, you’ll find that your project takes two to three times longer – costing you more money and delaying the release of your project.
<h3>Quality is Better from a U.S. Based Company</h3>
Language barriers also prevent overseas companies from providing a quality product. While they may have great work ethics, language barriers prevent accurate design and coding. A US-based company handles all architecture and user experience design, so your product is designed to your specifications for your specified target customer. Also, when you don’t have cultural differences, you deliver a better quality product for your US-based customers.
<h3>Projects Are Delivered Faster</h3>
In general, projects that are handled by a US-based management company are completed faster than those that are outsourced directly overseas. This is because they have the communication skills, the trained team and capability of completing your project on time. Also, overseas companies, especially in areas like India, suffer from high turnover rates – which means your project could go on hold for months waiting for a new, qualified team member to be hired and pick up where the past employee left off.
<h3>The Value of Your Project is Better</h3>
<p>
  
Value is the main goal of your project. A US-based management company, like Neubloc, develops programs that are aimed at adding value directly back into your company. Our consultants offer a team of industry professionals that will help offer insight into your project, find the right company to outsource your project to, etc.

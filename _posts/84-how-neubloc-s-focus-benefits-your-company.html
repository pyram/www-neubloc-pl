Neubloc believes in “rightsource” software design and development. That means we help you take your outsourcing project to the next level using our flexible roadmap for outsourcing. Unlike other management firms, Neubloc is exclusively focused on product development, which means we can offer a more in-depth analysis of your software project and help you find the proper resources to complete the job on time.
</p>
   

<h3>How Our Consulting Services Work</h3>
When you use Neubloc, you sit down with our consultant and have your project analyzed for the appropriate outsourcing plan. The plan includes all activities (before, during and after outsourcing) that should be implemented for maximum success of your product. Some things you can expect to receive include:
<ul>
	<li>An analysis of the goals of your project – helping us determine a better outsourcing plan for it.</li>
	<li>An analysis of any existing or future products – so we can identify what company to outsource based on their size, skills, culture, and intellectual property constraints.</li>
	<li>An in-depth analysis of what skills are required for your design and development product to be completed at the highest quality.</li>
	<li>The roles and positions required to take your product to completion.</li>
</ul>

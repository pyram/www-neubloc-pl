As of right now, India still has one of the highest numbers for offshore outsourcing of IT services. They’re still expected to grow in the coming years, but does that mean they are the right choice for outsourcing your software development? Contrary to the numbers, India’s rising costs and failing quality has made them a significant liability for most companies. In fact, for some firms, outsourcing software development to India could actually make their product fail.
</p>
   

<h3>Infrastructure is Still Lacking</h3>
A decade ago, India has a significant infrastructure issue and that still hasn’t changed today. In fact, according to some, the infrastructure might actually be getting worse in the country rather than better.
<h3>Costs are on the Rise</h3>
Because of economic laws and the supply and demand, India costs are on the rise – and significantly. Indian software development services used to be one of the most cost-effective, but they have been reporting significant payment increases over the past few years. Also, the value of the Indian rupee is on the rise, which means the US dollar’s value is going to go negative. To negate the costs in India, some software developers are outsourcing their outsourced products to areas like Beijing and Buenos Aires. So, if Indian development firms are shopping around, it is a good indicator you should be too.
<h3>Limited Touch</h3>
You might have completed the project or gotten the contract started, but how much back and forth is there between your US company and your Indian software development firm? Because of the 12 to 14 hour time difference, you won’t ever speak to a live person from your firm unless you’re up at 3:00am. This significant lack of communication and collaboration has led to the downfall of numerous software projects over the past decade – and will likely bring on a few hundred more.
<h3>Who You Hire Today Will Be Gone Tomorrow</h3>
<p>You’ve heard about the high attrition rates in India, but have you thought about how those affect your company? High attrition means that you are likely to have multiple employee turnovers on your single development project. In fact, Indian companies are reporting 50 to 70 percent attrition per year. That means you could have 50 to 70 percent of your development project’s staff change out before it’s done. Also, most of the attrition involves high level or senior-level developers. And, because there is a significant lack of equal talent in India, it could take weeks or months to find a replacement.</p>

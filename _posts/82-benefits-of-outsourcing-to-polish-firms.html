Today there is a new trend in outsourcing software development: sending it to Poland. Most people think of India or China when they hear about outsourcing, so what is making Poland so attractive? Poland developers have long been in the running for excellence, but only recently have more US companies realized just how beneficial it is to send their projects across to Europe. If you’re not sure whether or not Poland is the right choice for you, think again and consider these benefits.

<h3>Attrition Rates are Low</h3>
Countries like China and India have high attrition rates. That means people you hire for your project are unlikely to still work on it in the coming months. Poland, like the US, has a steady workforce and dedicated employees. In fact, their software development firms strive to have long-term employees and work hard at their retention rates. Employees are more loyal in Poland, similar to the US.
<h3>Your Intellectual Property is Protected</h3>
You’ve spent time and money developing your software idea, so why would you send it to a company that doesn’t take that seriously? Intellectual property rights in India are a joke. They don’t care about your product, and they don’t care if someone steals the idea. In Poland, laws about IP are similar to the US, which means Polish firms will work hard to protect your intellectual property – at all costs too.
<h3>The Quality is Better</h3>
Poland developers deliver quality similar to that of the US. They believe in following specifications set by their customers, but also they don’t have the same communication or cultural barriers countries like China and India have – that means less confusion during the development process.
<h3>Talent is Better</h3>
What you might not know about Poland is that they have a very strong base for software embedment and development. In fact, they are a hot region for Web 2.0 technology and have some of the best developers in the world working for their companies. China and India, on the other hand, have some of the weakest talent and most of their talented professionals don’t take on outsourcing jobs.
<h3>Work Ethic</h3>
In India, you will find it hard to get results right way. In fact, it could be months before the development firm ever touches your product. But, in Poland, they care about your product and are motivated to get it done. They don’t stop for clarification on everything – because they don’t need to. They’re observant to time, understand the budget and schedule, and work hard to meet it – just like a US team would do.

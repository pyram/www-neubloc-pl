								<p>South America might not seem like a possibility when outsourcing software development, but with Argentina and Ecuador emerging as the next IT hotspots, Neubloc encourages companies to rethink their outsourcing destination. Neubloc also offers its development and “follow the sun” models to help companies RightSource the “right” way.</p>
 
<h1>Why Argentina?</h1>
<p>Argentina is not only eagerly adopting IT, it has become a regional leader in the research and development of advanced technologies. With many industries to choose from, Argentina is ideal ground for start-ups and it offers:</p>
<ul>
	<li> A large pool of talented technical professionals:</li>
  <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><img src="../images/WhySouthAmerica1.gif" alt="" /></p>
	<li> Over 100 institutions supporting IT</li>
	<li> A stable, growing economic platform</li>
</ul>
<h1>Why Ecuador?</h1>
<p>Ecuador has excellent university training in technical skills and its institutions offer higher-level degrees in mathematics, engineering, and computer science. Moreover, Ecuador’s growing software industry promises:</p>
<ul>
	<li> A diverse, low cost labor pool</li>
	<li> High English fluency</li>
	<li> A strong resource pool for web technologies</li>
	<li> An expanding IT sector:</li>
  <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><img src="../images/WhySouthAmerica2.gif" alt="" /></p>
</ul>
<p>Both countries enforce IP laws similar to the US and Europe, unlike their Indian and Chinese counterparts.</p>
<h1>RightSourcing the Right Way</h1>
<p>Neubloc has extensive experience working with startups from seed stage all the way to their I.P.O. and has overseen all stages of the product development process. By following specific models, Neubloc has RightSourced software design and development throughout the United States, Eastern Europe and South America.</p>

<p>To help make the transition, Neubloc makes rightsourcing to South America easier with their development model by:</p>
<ul>
	<li> Maximizing utilization of resources</li>
	<li> Making effectively use of time</li>
	<li> Allowing around-the-clock software development</li>
	<li> Reducing labor and overhead costs</li>
	<li> Implementing through near or offshore development centers</li>
</ul>
<p>Neubloc also uses the “follow the sun” model, which utilizes:</p>
<ul>
	<li> A whole project management team instead of a single overall project manager</li>
	<li> Additional time for setup and code management</li>
	<li> Enough time to build and explain detailed specifications as well as requirements</li>
</ul>
<p>So whether a company is well-developed or just starting out, South America offers a wide variety of skilled labor, reduced IP risk and economically stable grounds for RightSourcing software design and development.</p>

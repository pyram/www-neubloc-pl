								<p>Designers usually are not the end-users of a given product, but most engineered products are marketed with little or no user input or involvement. Co-design is a design practice utilizing User Centered Design (UCD) that relies on user input to aid product design before marketing it.</p>
<p>This approach has several advantages:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. Greater customer demand</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Improved user adoption</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. Higher user satisfaction</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">4. Increased product profitability
</p> 
<p>Moreover, co-designed products have many ROI benefits. By gathering user input early on in the design process, firms avoid costly fixes caused by mismanaged resources and time. Co-design seamlessly integrates with market-driven product management practices to identify market problems and how to solve them by interacting, observing and understanding the user’s needs. This brings target users into product planning and design, which increases the likelihood of success for the project</p>

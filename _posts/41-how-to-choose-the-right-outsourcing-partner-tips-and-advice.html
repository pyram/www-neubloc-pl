								<p>There are two main reasons to seek an outsourcing partner:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. To speed up the process of bringing new products to market</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. To decrease the time lapse between mistakes that may cause delays in the production process</p>
<p>In today's rapidly developing and cut throat market economy, it is pertinent to deliver products to the market in a timely manner. What should one look for in the right outsourcing partner? The ideal company to outsource to will:</p>
 
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. Accelerate time to market and provide a competitive edge</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Have a quality development team that ensures usable and technically sound products</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. Uphold legal IP laws and provide structured development</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">4. Provide optimum results with minimum cost expenditure</p>
<p>These four principles are more clearly outlined below:</p>
<h1>Principle 1: Accelerate Time</h1>
<p>To successfully bring a product to market quickly involves numerous aspects such as:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. Development philosophy</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Team productivity</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. Company attrition</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">4. Difference in time zones</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">5. Economic and political stability of the outsourced company</p>
<p>The primary approach should always focus on the user's needs instead of merely applying technology to fulfill a task on time. To do this, the team needs to function independently of the main company, so that in case of emergencies the team can address the problem in the most effective manner and continue with work instead of waiting for orders from the chief company. This requires a team that is flexible and readily adapts to change. Effective communication, both written and verbal, is also vital for seamless function.</p>
<h1>Principle 2: Product Quality</h1>
<p>To ensure the best product quality, the team needs to combine:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. Knowledge</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Skills</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. Experience</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">4. Specification and processes</p>
<p>What factors can guarantee this in the employees? If the country to outsource to has plenty of universities and values education, the graduates that join the outsourced company are likely to possess these qualities. Besides a capable team, it is necessary to provide proper specifications from the start to allow for a smooth process and ensure a quality project. Solid team capabilities coupled with sound processes and specifications lead to a better quality product.</p>
<h1>Principle 3: Ownership and IP Risk</h1>
<p>Intellectual property theft is a common occurrence in countries like India where the laws are lax and the Indian court system does not favor foreign companies. It is important to choose a company based in a country with similar IP laws to the U.S. which are properly enforced.</p>
<h1>Principle 4: Cost Control</h1>
<p>Burn rate is important to all companies and companies are compelled to outsource due to lower labor costs overseas than in their own country. However, when drawing a contract, it pays to pay attention and leave the contract flexible to the market and technical requirements that will change during the development process. Other things to consider include:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. Hourly vs monthly rate</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. Who shoulders the risk responsibility</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">4. Stability of the country's currency and inflation rate</p>

								<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Companies are increasingly outsourcing software development to reduce costs and leverage today’s globalized economy. Amanda Viteri of Neubloc shares the pros and cons of outsourcing software development, from an expert’s point of view.</span>
 
<h1>Why Outsource?</h1>
<p>Many companies choose to outsource for its many benefits:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. A wider global talent pool to choose from</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Lower operational and labor costs</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. Reduced time to bring product to market</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">4. Expand and gain access to new market areas</p>
<p>Access to talent across the globe reduces the difficulty when creating a full team and needed infrastructure. It also gives access to high level talent, such as usability experts, architects and program managers. Labor costs are comparatively less expensive in some countries like Argentina, Poland, or China.</p>
<h1>The Third Party Advantage</h1>
<p>Outsourcing engages third party validation and parallel development which brings in global expertise and reduces the time of development. This ultimately brings a better product to market.</p>

<p>Third parties add to an existing project on the level of:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. Project management</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. System building</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. System testing</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">4. Tracking bugs</p>
<p>Because they already have recruited staff in-house, third parties are quick to deploy. Forming third parties also forms distant or contract-based relationships, which leaves a graceful way out for the company with no personal feelings involved if the business does not go as planned.</p>
<h1>Outsourcing Pitfalls</h1>
<p>While there are clear benefits companies enjoy with outsourcing, there are also obstacles companies must overcome when outsourcing. The most common pitfalls occur when choosing a country to outsource to.</p>

<p>IT hotspots like India and, more recently, Poland have their own pros and cons. While Poland might not be as inexpensive as India, it offers better IP protection and higher-tiered skilled labor. Poland’s work ethic is also similar to Western ideals and many Polish workers can speak European or Asian languages fluently along with fluent English.</p>

<p>Dissimilar work ethics in both countries can lead to a project failure or terminate a contract. For example, a country’s economic stability has an impact on marketplace pressures.</p>

<p>If there is wage inflation, like India is currently experiencing, this raises marketplace pressure and forces many companies to look for alternatives in countries such as Eastern Europe and South America in order to remain financially competitive.</p>
<h1>How to Stay Afloat</h1>
<p>To swim in the seas of outsourcing without drowning, Forbes suggests some things to consider before outsourcing to a company:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. Create a back up in-house infrastructure in the case that the outsourced company fails</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Establish a flexible contract with full awareness of IP risks and economical disadvantages of the country</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. Have in-source staff that is fully aware of the services provided by the outsourced company and retains the skill levels necessary to evaluate such in source staff. This is invaluable in recruiting or handling problems when it comes to dealing with outsourced companies.</p>
In short, while outsourcing software development is the most common path taken by virtually all companies, it is important to touch all points before establishing a contract.

<p>Evaluating the country’s profile and understanding the work ethics or contributions of the people helps in evaluating whether this company will be beneficial to outsource to in the long run.</p>

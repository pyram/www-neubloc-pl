A lot of companies are no longer outsourcing their software development to India – and for good reason. It is a myth that outsourcing to India will save you money or create better bang for your buck. You know you shouldn’t believe everything you read, but it is easy to get caught up in the hype of outsourcing promises. But, outsourcing to India has more disadvantages than advantages, which is why we are highlighting the common myths about outsourcing your software development there.</p>
 

<h3>Myth #1: Outsourcing to India is Cheaper</h3>
This isn’t always the case. There are Indian programming professionals that have no structural integrity or don’t know how to assess something before it is deleted in the system – including things that cost thousands of dollars in licensing fees. Just because Indian developers are cheap doesn’t mean they will build an efficient product either. Also, when a program has errors, they do a quick patch job rather than getting to the root of the issue – which means you’ll have an improperly functioning product. More hours are spent fixing and refining projects completed in India, which means you’ll spend more of your budget fixing it than just hiring the right professional the first time around.
<h3>Myth #2: Outsourcing Software Development to India is Easy</h3>
The cultural differences and communication issues make development impossible. It’s hard to translate your technical and architectural language to your Indian developers. Also, it is next to impossible to create a list of project goals and clear instructions – because they don’t have as firm of an understanding of English as you do. Misunderstandings are common and projects that are outsourced to India rarely evolve in the direction they were meant to. This can lead to significant delays in the project, downtime, or a loss of critical data altogether.
<h3>Myth #3: Programmers and Developers from India are Better</h3>
While there are some highly skilled, talented programmers in India, the majority of them are only hired by your project company to make the code – they don’t actually develop anything. Also, most development companies will hire only one skilled developer – the rest are trainees with no schooling or experience in software development. Also, better developers in the country are usually hired by large companies not accepting outsourcing jobs. And, because of the higher turnover rates, you are likely to have multiple developers working on your single project.
<h3>Myth #4: Software Development in India is Safe</h3>
<p>In India there are no intellectual property laws. That means if the company you hire doesn’t take precautions, your software could be captured and created by another company long before yours is ever released on the market.</p>
<p>The risks of outsourcing software development to India outweigh the advantages. If you’re considering outsourcing your software project, trust in the professionals from Neubloc instead. Neubloc has a strict methodology for outsourcing and completing development projects, which means you’ll get the most for your money without the headaches of outsourcing yourself.</p>

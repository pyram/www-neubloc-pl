Companies that used to solely outsource to India have started hunting for new prospects. From the outrageous attrition rates and low quality scores, it is apparent India is no longer the leader for software development outsourcing. But, what about Poland? Some companies are shifting their focus from India to Poland, but is making the switch right for you? By understanding what makes Poland a better option than India you can weigh your options more efficiently.</p>
 

&nbsp;
<h3>Attrition Rates Slow Productivity</h3>
In Indian development firms, the annual attrition rate still averages about 50 percent, while smaller Indian development firms have a 100 percent attrition rate. That means if your project spans over a year (as most do) you could see half to all of your development team change over. In Poland, jobs are more stable and attrition rates rest below 10 percent – which means there is more reliability.

&nbsp;
<h3>IP Security and Risks</h3>
Indian development firms are known for their relaxed approach to internet security. In fact, they have often been accused of taking their customers’ codes and creating their own software version from it. While steps are being taken to prevent this from happening in the future, there are still no intellectual property rights in India, which means your project could be stolen. In Poland, on the other hand, the European Union has strict IP laws – similar to the United States. That means your project would be safer than if you sent it to India.

&nbsp;
<h3>Talent</h3>
Poland has a strong number of developers, and they’re one of the hottest countries for Web 2.0 technology. In India, most software development focuses on IT, but they have limited resources when it comes to finding quality senior developers.

&nbsp;
<h3>Cost Considerations</h3>
There is always a significant price difference between European and Indian software development companies. Back in the day, Indian developers only cost $1 to $2k each month, but India is now increasing payment by 20 percent every half year. The junior engineers in India are cheaper than Poland, but in a few more years India will surpass Poland in costs – making them no longer the economical choice.

&nbsp;
<h3>Quality and Communication Barriers</h3>
India is notorious for providing low-quality products. This is due to a significant communication and cultural barrier. As a US based organization, you will spend more funds correcting the issues of an Indian developer. But, in Poland, English is used just as frequently – meaning you are less likely to run into communication errors or quality issues because of language barriers.

&nbsp;

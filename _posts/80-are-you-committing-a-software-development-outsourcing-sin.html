The process of software design and development isn’t easy – that is why you’re outsourcing the job. But, if you’re not doing it right, you could make a development project cost you more time and money – or bankrupt you altogether. Development outsourcing is all about avoiding the common sins, but to avoid them, you have to know what they are.</p>
 
<h3><strong>Did You Hire a Firm that Specializes in Development?</strong></h3>
Software firms usually have two specialties: IT services and product development. These are two entirely different products – an IT service cannot handle software development. Also, even when you hire a software development company, how much research did you put into it before signing a contract? Some things you should know about the firm include:
<ul>
	<li>How long their development team has worked together and will be together.</li>
	<li>How the specification process is conducted.</li>
	<li>What additional services they can offer to your company.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Technical Knowledge: What Do They Have to Offer?</strong></h3>
You need a company that has development experience with the type of platform or technology you need your software to perform on. For example, if you want a Linux program, you won’t hire a Windows-based firm. If you don’t know the technology you need, it’s best to sit down and decide what options you have and how hard it will be to convert the project to the technology once you pick one.
<h3><strong>Did You Pick a Firm That is Too Small? Too Large?</strong></h3>
There is always some middle ground to software development firms. Ideally, you want a team of at least 3 to 10 developers, but always below 50. This is because the more people put on a team, the more likely you are to have low-level employees handling the bulk of your work. At the same time, if you go with a company that is too small, you could not have enough people on the team to get the work done.
<h3><strong>Did You Pick an Offshore Software Development Firm?</strong></h3>
There is a right way and a wrong way to use offshore services. Offshore developers could be working from their homes or friend’s basement for all you know. So how much research did you put into the company you’re using? Most offshore companies charge significantly less for their services, but that often means you get a lower quality product in the end.
<h3><strong>Did You Make Sure Your Product is Secure?</strong></h3>
Some companies don’t have intellectual property laws like the United States does. India, for example, does not have IP laws that protect your codes. So that means someone could intercept and develop your product and you would have no way to seek retribution.
<h3><strong>Use Neubloc for Your Software Development</strong></h3>
Neubloc has strict software development methodologies that deliver results. From outsourcing to companies in Europe to providing you with turnkey development solutions, you will never have a product that is subpar or over-budget.

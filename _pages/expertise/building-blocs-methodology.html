								<h3><b>Overview</b></h3>
<p>Neubloc's software design and development methodology, Building Blocs, is based on the very best practices integrated from years of numerous engagements and internal product development. Our proven methodology increases our client's success by delivering products and solutions that satisfy project requirements in a timely fashion. Building Blocs has proven to be essential to meet challenging project needs as well as effective management over multidisciplinary teams, both near and offshore.</p>

<p>Our methodology allows collaboration to determine the appropriate, custom approach to your requirements:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Discovery</li>
	<li>Definition</li>
	<li>Design</li>
	<li>Development and Testing</li>
	<li>Deployment</li>
	<li>Maintenance</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach has been designed to allow entry at any phase during the service or product lifecycle.</p>
<h3><b>Methodology</b></h3>
<p>Successful projects do not just happen; they are created. In Neubloc's experience of managing complex projects, we have found that a successful project outcome mandates the use of disciplined project management practices. A disciplined approach provides effective team communication and structure to maintain control and ensure that projects are completed on time and within budget. Since every project and client is unique, Neubloc adjusts according to the Building Blocs management strategy in order to address the unique characteristics of each project.</p>
<h4>Interactive Lifecycle Management</h4>
<p>Successful management of software design and development projects begins with an accurate estimation of costs and schedules. This is followed by efficient resource utilization and risk management to track specified delivery requirements. At its core, Neubloc's iterative management process has constant project status monitoring, refinement and validation in order to ensure alignment with business objectives.</p>
<h4>Focus on Quality</h4>
<p>Neubloc's number one goal is contributing to our clients' success by ensuring high quality throughout our design and development process. Quality assurance engineers are typically involved in the early phases of a project to make certain quality is central to each effort. We utilize a number of quality tools in all of our projects:</p>
<ul>
	<li>User and technical validation</li>
	<li>Usability testing</li>
	<li>Software test plans</li>
	<li>Test cases</li>
	<li>Code reviews</li>
	<li>Acceptance test plans</li>
</ul>
<h4>Integrated Global Delivery</h4>
<p>Every project that we undertake is staffed with a resourceful team equipped with appropriate skills and level of experience. Our globalized teams allow us to provide the right resources at the right time and for the right price.</p>

<p>Our global teams are comprised of:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Project leaders</li>
	<li>Architects</li>
	<li>Designers,</li>
	<li>Usability specialists</li>
	<li>Engineers</li>
</ul>
<p>Working seamlessly as a blended team, these vital components of our team take advantage of our U.S. and European locations in order to maximize the available daily work hours.</p>
<h4>Delivery Process</h4>
<p>In addition to the creation of any system approached solely from an engineering perspective, business and usability issues should also be addressed. Neubloc's overlapping approach ensures an end product that satisfies requirements from all stakeholders and adoption by end users. The methodology is based on PMI, CMM and RUP and is flexible, verifiable and repeatable to fit our clients' needs. The diagram above illustrates the high-level tasks and deliveries that occur during each phase of a projectâ€™s lifecycle.</p>

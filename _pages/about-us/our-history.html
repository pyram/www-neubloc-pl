<p>Neubloc was originally founded in 1999 by a group of successful enterprise software executives. They recognized early on that leverage and value from offshore development could only be achieved when coupled with near shore management, strategy, proven processes and discipline. </p>

  <p>Initially the company focused on acquiring software companies and integrating an offshore model for enhanced development of the acquired products. This eventually evolved into providing custom design and development services to clients.

<p>
Neubloc's process model, Building Blocs, implements near and off shore development and has been successfully utilized numerous times for global product development companies. Neubloc's background in product development and services has prepared our employees to think differently than typical outsource engineering firms because we know what it takes to deliver commercially viable, supportable, maintainable, quality designs and solutions.</p>

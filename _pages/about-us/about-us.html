                <p>Neubloc is a primarily U.S.-based, outsource software design and development firm that employs a unique RightSource model. This model couples the best of near shore design and project management with highly educated, experienced, and proven engineering resources near and off shore. Neubloc resources can be found in our offices throughout North America, near shore operations with our Argentinean and Ecuadorian locations, and off shore operations in multiple Central and Eastern European cities.

                    We transcend the broken promises of time and cost efficiency from previous offshore models. In addition, we understand that work shipped offshore will fail without defined processes, clear communications, and the right balance of onshore, near shore and offshore resources. Only when a stable equilibrium between all of these aspects has been achieved, can productivity and savings be delivered.

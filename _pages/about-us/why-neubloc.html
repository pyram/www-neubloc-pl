<p>Neubloc is a leading provider of comprehensive software product design, development, planning and support. Our teams of business, design and technology professionals are focused on delivering market-driven product solutions that address development challenges and meet management goals and expectations.</p>

<p>Embedded software collaboration on an international scale requires an intimate understanding of the formal and informal institutions governing businesses abroad. Failure to understand and appreciate the social, economic, cultural and political environment can be disastrous. Factors like technology affinity, labor laws and rates, IP law, attrition rates and cultural affinity to software development can all have a direct impact on the quality and success of a product.</p>

<p>Neubloc understands the continuing rapid evolution of product and technology landscapes and the importance of making correct foundational decisions at the start of any project.</p>

<p>OurRightSource Roadmap™ solution provides an in-depth analysis of the feasibility of sending a project offshore, the financial impact of a project’s life cycle, and the approach to accomplish the project goals and objectives.</p>

<h3>UNBIASED EXPERTISE</h3>
<p>Neubloc's resource allocation is determined through a project-by-project basis and the unique developmental requirements of a client, supported with the best strategic decision making for each US-based customer.</p>

<p>Different formal and informal institutions in each nation and geography directly affect the potential success and cost effectiveness of going offshore, including:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Technical affinity</li>
	<li>Local attrition</li>
	<li>Labor rates</li>
	<li>Wage inflation</li>
	<li>IP protection</li>
	<li>Legal conditions</li>
	<li>University standards and quality</li>
</ul>


<p>Without specific domain expertise, it is difficult to select the right location for any given project. This can lead to astronomical failure rates, out of control costs, and losing control of a source or a stolen product.</p>

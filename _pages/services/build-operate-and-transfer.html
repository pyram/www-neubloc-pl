								<p>Neubloc specializes in setting up outsourced development teams for small and medium sized software product companies. We provide you with a low-risk solution with minimal capital investment, helping you to reserve equity and cash, focus on innovation, leverage our experience and infrastructure and minimize your time and effort.</p>
<h3>Build</h3>
<p>We get your development operations started quickly by using our existing infrastructure. We hire new team resources based on specific needs to ensure possession of a proper domain experience, as opposed to picking from an existing pool of consultants.</p>
<h3>Operate</h3>
<p>We provide and modify processes that align with yours to ensure offshore resources are integrated tightly. After process integration and setup, we build the team to the desired size and strength.</p>
<h3>Transfer</h3>
<p>After a specified time frame that aligns with your company objectives, we help you incorporate your offshore company, set up facilities for you and transfer all the resources.</p>
